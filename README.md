# Scope
- What is a scope in js ?

    The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions
    are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not in the current
    scope, it will not be available for use

- Kinds of Scopes:

  Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
  
  Block scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared
              inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block.
